Binstar Client
==============

This is a command line client that provides an interface to the Binstar restful API.

Quickstart:

First create an account on [binstar.org](https://binstar.org)

If you are not using Anaconda 1.6+ install the client:

``` 
    $ conda install binstar
      #then update it for good measure
    $ conda update binstar
```

Login:

` $ binstar login`

Test your login with the whoami command:

` $ binstar whoami`
